What is "Meteor Kitchen"?
=========================

"Meteor Kitchen" is a meteor application code generator. Just describe your application in simple JSON file and use meteor-kitchen to build an (almost) complete meteor application with:

- Directory structure
- Router and route controllers
- Collections (pubs & subs)
- Layout
- Pages (with content)
- Menus
- Forms (with validations)
- DataViews (components you can use to show data from collections with search & sort functions)

**And more:** in addition with built-in components, you can write your own **plugins** in javascript and expand generator to the unlimited.
